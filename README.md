The company wants to develop a website that allows users to find accommodation and activities in the city of their choice.

I am responsible for integrating the interface of the site with HTML and CSS code. For this, I work in close collaboration with Sarah, the CTO, and Lo√Øc, the UI designer.

My task is to create the Booki travel agency home page with HTML AND CSS based on Lo√Øc's Figma model.
The realization must be done by following the specifications, the responsive must include, in addition to the pc format, the tablet and mobile formats.
